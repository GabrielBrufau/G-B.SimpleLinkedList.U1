    <h1>Data Structures-Linked list simple</h1>
    <p>An linked list are data structure very similar to a arrays, where the access to the element or node <br>
         is through a pointer instead of the index or key
        <br>
        <br>
        #1
        HEAD => THIS.HEAD => NULL/or/NODE => THIS.DATA; <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; THIS.SIZE = 0; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THIS.NEXT => NULL/or/NODE =>etc.etc.ect
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>one form</h2>
        cass Node{ <br>
            &emsp;constructor(data,next){<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  this.data = data; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; this.next = next;<br>
                &emsp;  }; <br>
        }; <br>
        <br>
        class Linkedlist { <br>
            &emsp;constructor(){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;this.head = null; <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;this.size = 0; <br>
            &emsp;};<br>
        };
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>another form</h2>
        function Node (value) { <br>
            &emsp; this.value = value <br>
            &emsp; this.next = null <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          function LinkedList() { <br>
            &emsp; this.head = null <br>
          } <br>
        <br>
          something interzing from the lists that it can be as an advantage over arrays for example if we add a new <br>
        element in an array it wil verify that there is a contiguous memory space available for the new element and if <br>
        it has not moved the entire array to another place in memory where if there is a full space, this does not happen <br>
        with the list, items may be scattered in memory <br>
        <br>
        we can play a little bit with these kinds of structures <br>
        <br>
        adding nodes to the list <br>
        look at #1 above on the page watch as head joins the nodes think a little bit how it works
