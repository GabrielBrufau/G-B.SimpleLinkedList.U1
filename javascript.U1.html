    <h1>Data Structures-Linked list simple</h1>
    <p>An linked list are data structure very similar to a arrays, where the access to the element or node <br>
         is through a pointer instead of the index or key
        <br>
        <br>
        #1
        HEAD => THIS.HEAD => NULL/or/NODE => THIS.DATA; <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; THIS.SIZE = 0; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THIS.NEXT => NULL/or/NODE =>etc.etc.ect
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>one form</h2>
        cass Node{ <br>
            &emsp;constructor(data,next){<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  this.data = data; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; this.next = next;<br>
                &emsp;  }; <br>
        }; <br>
        <br>
        class Linkedlist { <br>
            &emsp;constructor(){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;this.head = null; <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;this.size = 0; <br>
            &emsp;};<br>
        };
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>another form</h2>
        function Node (value) { <br>
            &emsp; this.value = value <br>
            &emsp; this.next = null <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          function LinkedList() { <br>
            &emsp; this.head = null <br>
          } <br>
        <br>
          something interzing from the lists that it can be as an advantage over arrays for example if we add a new <br>
        element in an array it wil verify that there is a contiguous memory space available for the new element and if <br>
        it has not moved the entire array to another place in memory where if there is a full space, this does not happen <br>
        with the list, items may be scattered in memory <br>
        <br>
        we can play a little bit with these kinds of structures <br>
        <br>
        adding nodes to the list <br>
        look at #1 above on the page watch as head joins the nodes think a little bit how it works
        for this situation we have to look for the node whose next is null(that means  that an the node I'm standing on is the last one) <br>
        and it's important to highlight this that the 'next' is null ... remember that nodes only know  <br>
        their predecessor, so if we were standing in null we can't meke the old one poin to new node !. so we'll step back and  <br>
        reassigned node.next, now yes, toward the new node.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Add Node at End (append) one form</h3>
        <br>
        LinkedList.prototype.append = function(value, current = this.head){ <br>
          &emsp; if(this.head === null){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;return this.head = new Node(value) <br>
            &emsp;} <br>
            &emsp; if(current.next === null){ <br>
              &emsp; &emsp;return current.next = new Node(value) <br>
              &emsp;} <br>
              &emsp;&emsp; this.append(value, current.next) <br>
        } <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Another form</h3>
        add(data){<br>
          &emsp;const newNode = new Node(data,null); <br>
          &emsp;if(!this.head){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;this.head = newNode <br>
            &emsp; }else{ <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;let current = this.head; <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;while(current.next){ <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;current = current.next; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;}; <br>
              &emsp;this.size++ <br>
              &emsp;}; <br>
        }; <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Add node to beginning</h3>
        In this particular case the important thing is, first create the new node and then point it to what points head finally <br>
         head reassigb it to the new node. <br>
         if we did it in reverse, that is, firt we put the head assignment to the new node, we lose the reference of the rest of the nodes <br>
         <br>
          <h3>one form</h3>
          LinkedList.prototype.prepend = function(value){ <br>
            &emsp;if(this.head === null){ <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;return this.head = new Node(value) <br>
              &emsp;} <br>
              &emsp;let newNode = new Node(value) <br>
              &emsp;newNode.next = this.head <br>
              &emsp; this.head = newNode <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Removing nodes to the list</h3>


          the simplest case is to want to delete the first element, in that case head points to head.next <br>
          now to delete any other items, the first thing is to locate the node before the searched one(that we do asking for next)and point <br>
           that node the next from which we wnt to delete <br>
           <br>
           <h3>One form  whit recursive</h3>
           LinkedList.prototype.removeNode = function (value, current = this.head) { <br>

          &emsp;&emsp;      return false // no match found <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Removing nodes to the list through position</h3>
          LinkedList.prototype.removeFromPos = function(pos,current = this.head,i=0){ <br>

          <h3>looking for a node</h3>
          there's not much to explain .. if it matches the item it returns true , <br>
